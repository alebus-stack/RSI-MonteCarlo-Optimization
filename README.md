# RSI-MonteCarlo-Optimization
**Advanced algorithmic trading strategy using the Relative Strength Index (RSI), optimized with Monte Carlo simulations and validated via rigorous walk-forward analysis.**
This project provides a comprehensive Python framework for:
- Fetching historical financial data (using yfinance).
- Backtesting a customizable RSI-based mean-reversion or momentum strategy.
- Robust parameter optimization using **Monte Carlo** techniques to find optimal RSI entry/exit thresholds.
- Out-of-sample validation through **walk-forward analysis** to prevent overfitting.
- Generating detailed performance metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown) and visualizations (equity curves, trade timelines).
